    <p>HABIT
        Home Automation Bridge for Intelligent Tasks
        A local-first, LLM-native protocol and hardware ecosystem for controlling, understanding, and reasoning about smart devices.
        
        What is HABIT?
        HABIT is a lightweight system that connects physical devices to an offline AI brain (LLM), allowing users to control appliances, monitor environments, and receive intelligent feedback — all via natural language and JSON-based device schemas.
        
        It’s not just a smart home system. It’s a context-aware, privacy-first automation platform with reasoning at its core.
        
        What Can HABIT Do?
        Turn devices on/off or set modes using plain English
        Understand device capabilities from JSON schemas
        Monitor real-time sensor data and report insights
        Forecast impact of user actions on energy usage
        Generate natural-language monthly reports
        Operate fully offline, with optional cloud backup
        Example Use Cases
        “Turn on the fan and set it to low.”
        “Is the heater running?”
        “What’s the cost of running the AC every night this month?”
        “Summarize my power usage this week.”
        “Don’t allow the oven to run longer than 2 hours.”
        System Components
        Component	Description
        Device Nodes	ESP32-based modules attached to appliances
        HABIT Hub	Raspberry Pi or edge device hosting LLM + control logic
        Protocol	JSON schema for describing devices, capabilities, and states
        LLM Core	Local model (Mistral, Phi2, etc.) using schema for decision making
        Security	Offline auth, role-based access, device pairing
        Logging	Local logs + optional cloud backup via API/cron
        🚀 Getting Started
        Set up your HABIT Hub
        Install dependencies (Python 3.10+, Llama.cpp/Ollama, Node-RED optional)
        
        Flash a device node
        Upload firmware to ESP32 + connect relays/sensors
        
        Create a device schema
        Define device capabilities in JSON (schemas/fan_001.json)
        
        Run the local server
        python hub/main.py
        
        Ask your LLM:
        
        “Is the fan on?”
        “Turn off the heater after 10 minutes.”
        
        🔐 Security & Auth
        Role-based access (admin, guest, etc.)
        Token or pin-based local auth
        Optional fingerprint/NFC reader for identity
        📡 Connectivity
        Offline-first, local-only operations
        Wi-Fi or Zigbee/BLE device discovery
        Optional cloud sync for logs or OTA updates
        🧪 Roadmap
         HABIT Protocol v1.0 spec
         Plug-and-play schema autodiscovery
         Energy cost forecasting model
         Home rules engine (e.g., “never turn on oven when nobody’s home”)
         Mobile app / Dashboard UI
         Encrypted cloud backup module
        📜 License
        MIT — open-source and free for all tinkerers, researchers, and rebels.
